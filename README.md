Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/08879d094f3b4de3ac67832f4a56a6de/latest/en-US). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

1. Open the [Setup and Administration Guide for SAP Cloud ALM](https://help.sap.com/viewer/08879d094f3b4de3ac67832f4a56a6de/latest/en-US).
1. You can either:

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
