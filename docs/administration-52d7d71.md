# Administration

After the initial setup and configuration of SAP Cloud ALM, some administrative tasks may be required as part of the regular operations.

If you originally requested the provisioning of SAP Cloud ALM, you've received all required authorizations to work in these tools. If you didn't request SAP Cloud ALM, make sure that the required roles that are detailed in the **Prerequisites** sections of the following pages are assigned to you.
