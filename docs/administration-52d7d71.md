# Administration

After the initial setup and configuration of SAP Cloud ALM, some administrative tasks may be required as part of the regular operations.

Most of these tasks can be completed directly in SAP Cloud ALM. Others need to be managed from the SAP BTP cockpit and SAP for Me.

If you originally requested the provisioning of SAP Cloud ALM, you've received all required authorizations to work in these tools. If you didn't request SAP Cloud ALM, make sure that the required roles that are detailed in the **Prerequisites** sections of the following pages are assigned to you.
