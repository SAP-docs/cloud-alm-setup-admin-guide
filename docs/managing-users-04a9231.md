# Managing Users

After the initial onboarding of users during the [required setup](01_required_setup/step-2-assign-roles-to-users-in-sap-cloud-alm-7304b17.md), other tasks may arise for the administration of users in SAP Cloud ALM.

To carry out these tasks, make sure you have the *User Administrator* role.

For a complete guide to user management activities in SAP Cloud ALM, see [User Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/user-management) in the SAP Cloud ALM Application Help.
