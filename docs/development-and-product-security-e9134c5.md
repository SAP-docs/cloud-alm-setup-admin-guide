## Development Security

**Security Scans - SAST and FOSS**:

-   SAP performs daily scans for static application security testing \(SAST\).

-   SAP scans daily for vulnerabilities in the used free and open-source software \(FOSS\).


**Threat Modeling**:

-   For every new app and every new functionality, threat modeling is mandatory.

-   New software is only released after all risks are mitigated.


**Security Validation**: Regular security validations ensure that security requirements are fulfilled.

**Hacker Simulation and Penetration Test**: Regular external penetration tests enhance protection from outside attacks.

**Bug Bounty**: Constant security testing by external security researchers.

**Compliance Standards**:

-   SAP Cloud ALM is compliant with SAP-internal technical policies, procedures, directives, guidelines, and product standards, such as the directive for network device security and the directive for cloud infrastructure.

-   Employees and operators are bound to the SAP code of business conduct and other behavioral security standards, such as clean desk and communication.


**Security Product Standards**: SAP Cloud ALM follows the general SAP security product standards.

**Certifications and Compliance**: SAPâ€™s innovation lifecycle and the SDOL is certified in ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. SAP Cloud ALM follows these processes and controls for its development.

**Security Incident Management**:

-   An emergency plan for sudden security incidents is in place.

-   Security incidents are handled according to the Security Incident Management Process. This process foresees classification, containment, and resolving of the issue. Internal groups and decision-makers are involved as needed.


**Security Education and Awareness**: SAP employees that are involved in SAP Cloud ALM are regularly trained on the importance of security. Software developers are trained for secure programming.
