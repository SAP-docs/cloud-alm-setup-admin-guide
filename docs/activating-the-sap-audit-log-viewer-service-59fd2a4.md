# Activating the SAP Audit Log Viewer Service

By using the SAP Audit Log Viewer service for SAP BTP, you can view the audit logs to track the end user activity in SAP Cloud ALM.

Audit logs represent security-relevant chronological records that provide documentary evidence for an event or activity.

To display the audit logs in the *Audit Log Viewer Service* application on SAP BTP, subscribe to the SAP Audit Log Viewer service in your subaccount as described in [Audit Log Viewer for the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/e3baa5f1a0c64c44aac8ab3ea3d1b500.html).
