# Systems

Most systems can to be registered with an ABAP report.

When the registration in the system has been completed, the registered system is automatically displayed on the *Services & Systems* page. Once a technical system has been registered, a default logical system \(client\) is created and displayed in the *System Details*.

Only a few system types \(for example, *SAP Focused Run*, *Cloud Connector*, and *SAP Process Integration*\) can't be registered but need to be set up manually.

To find out what setup steps are required for your system, refer to [Setup Managed Services / Systems](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/setup-managed-services.html) in the SAP Cloud ALM for Operations Expert Portal.
