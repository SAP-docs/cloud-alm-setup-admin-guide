# Systems

The registration method of systems in SAP Cloud ALM depends on the system type of your solution.

To find out which setup steps are required for your system, refer to [Setup Managed Services / Systems](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/setup-managed-services.html) in the SAP Cloud ALM for Operations Expert Portal.

> ### Note:  
> Observability data from your connected systems isn't automatically sent to your SAP Cloud ALM tenant. If you want to start monitoring observability data, the data transfer to SAP Cloud ALM first needs to be configured.

## Case 1: Registration

Most systems can be registered with an ABAP report.

When the registration in the system has been completed, the registered system is automatically displayed on the *Services & Systems* page. Once a technical system has been registered, a default logical system \(client\) is created and displayed in the *System Details*.

For step-by-step guidance of the registration, find your system in the Expert Portal linked above.
