# Systems

Most systems can be registered with an ABAP report.

When the registration in the system has been completed, the registered system is automatically displayed on the *Services & Systems* page. Once a technical system has been registered, a default logical system \(client\) is created and displayed in the *System Details*.

Only a few system types \(for example, *SAP Focused Run*, *Cloud Connector*, and *SAP Process Integration*\) can't be registered but need to be set up manually.

Observability data from your connected systems isn't automatically sent to your SAP Cloud ALM tenant. If you want to start monitoring observability data, the data transfer to SAP Cloud ALM first needs to be configured.

To find out which setup steps are required for your system, refer to [Setup Managed Services / Systems](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/setup-managed-services.html) in the SAP Cloud ALM for Operations Expert Portal.
