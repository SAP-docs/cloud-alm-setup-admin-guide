# Step 3: Set Up Landscape Management

As the last step of the required setup, services and systems need to be set up in the *Landscape Management* app in SAP Cloud ALM.

Landscape management in SAP Cloud ALM helps you manage information about your services, systems, and business services. This information is the basis for all SAP Cloud ALM apps.

To see which services and systems are supported by SAP Cloud ALM, refer to [Supported Solutions](../supported-solutions-3ebab44.md).

## What Are Services and Systems?

In SAP Cloud ALM, services are understood as subscribed cloud services, that is, solutions and applications that are offered on-demand from the servers of a cloud provider \(SaaS\).

Systems are defined as on-premise systems, that is, solutions and applications that are provided by SAP but installed and run on the premises of the company or organization using them, or in a private cloud solution.

## Connecting Services and Systems

For more information on how services and systems are connected to SAP Cloud ALM, refer to the following subpages:

-   [Services](services-d5f36cc.md)

-   [Systems](systems-d9d672a.md)


> ### Note:  
> You have full control which data from managed services and systems is transferred to SAP Cloud ALM:
> 
> When you activate your SAP Cloud ALM tenant and register your systems and services in the *Landscape Management* app of SAP Cloud ALM, the collection of observability data is not started automatically. SAP Cloud ALM follows a central configuration approach: You need to explicitly configure the data collection processes.
> 
> In addition, SAP is moving from customer-managed connectivity \(established by customers\) to SAP-managed connectivity \(established by SAP\). To find out which additional steps are necessary to establish customer-managed connectivity, see [Connecting Systems and Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/setup-administration/connecting-systems-and-services).

## Access Control

By enabling access control, you can restrict the access of specific landscape objects \(services, systems, and business services\) to specific users.

For more information, see [Access Control](https://help.sap.com/viewer/877c96cf971648b09ee0d0a64f7f4fef/latest/en-US/bd0e50f5167a4b3ab8ebe3d35da1c74b.html "Access control allows you to restrict the access of specific landscape objects (services, systems, and business services) to specific users.") :arrow_upper_right:.
