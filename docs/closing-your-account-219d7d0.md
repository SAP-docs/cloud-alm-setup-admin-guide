# Closing Your Account

When your SAP contracts expire, your SAP Cloud ALM tenant and all related data will be deleted after a grace period has passed.

> ### Tip:  
> You can always check the contract end date on the [Provisioning](https://me.sap.com/systemsprovisioning/provisioning) dashboard on SAP for Me, in the column *Contract Start*.

The closing process starts with a notice period. The requester of the global account that contains your SAP Cloud ALM entitlement receives an email about the expiring contract, and a warning banner is displayed for the global account in the SAP BTP cockpit. If this happens, you can request an export of your data by opening an incident on component SV-CLM-INF-ONB, if required.

30 days after your contracts with SAP end, the SAP BTP global account is closed and access to your SAP Cloud ALM tenant is blocked. At this point, if you renew your SAP contracts, your account can still be restored to a fully active state without data loss.

60 days after your contracts with SAP expire, your global account and your SAP Cloud ALM tenant are fully decommissioned. All customer-related data for the account and for all associated services is deleted and cannot be restored or recovered.
