# Activating Access Control

With access control lists in the *Landscape Management* app, you can configure the ability of certain users to access specific landscape objects \(services, systems, and business services\).

By default, users with the appropriate roles can access landscape management and all landscape objects. There are no restrictions which landscape objects the user could see.

As a *Landscape Access Controller*, you can activate access control and configure access control lists, which allow you to restrict the visibility of specific landscape objects to specific users. These restrictions also apply to other SAP Cloud ALM apps.

> ### Note:  
> Once activated, you cannot deactivate access control any more due to security reasons. Therefore, before activating access control, first carry out the following steps:
> 
> -   Create a concept which users require access to which managed components.
> 
> -   Create corresponding access control lists.
> 
> -   Assign users to their corresponding access control lists.
> 
> -   Test access control.

For detailed information on how to activate access control and create access control lists, see [Access Control](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/access-control).
