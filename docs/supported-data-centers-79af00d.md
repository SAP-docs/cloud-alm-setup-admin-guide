> ### Note:  
> It's currently not possible to move your SAP Cloud ALM tenant from the data center in which it was originally provisioned to a different data center. However, if you're willing to accept loss of data, you can dismantle and resubscribe SAP Cloud ALM in a different data center by following the steps described in KBA [3352417](https://me.sap.com/notes/3352417).
