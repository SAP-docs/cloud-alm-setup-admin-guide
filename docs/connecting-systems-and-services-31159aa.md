# Connecting Systems and Services

Before you activate the monitoring applications in SAP Cloud ALM, you must connect the managed components to *Landscape Management*.

You usually do not need to create cloud services manually. The recommended way to import information about your subscribed services into *Landscape Management* is to use the automatic import from the System Landscape Information Service \(SLIS\). The system and service information is synchronized automatically each day.

For more information, see [Set Up Landscape Management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/08879d094f3b4de3ac67832f4a56a6de/latest/en-US/23f1c49b224b4f17b2d959e01ae9c930.html).

After your services and systems have been imported into SAP Cloud ALM, follow the product-specific setup steps described on the following pages.
