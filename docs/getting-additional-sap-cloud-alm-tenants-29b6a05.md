# Getting Additional SAP Cloud ALM Tenants

By subscribing to the microservice *SAP Cloud ALM, tenant extension*, you can get additional SAP Cloud ALM tenants for your customer number.

Here's how you can benefit from using this extension:

-   Use multiple productive tenants, for example, to provide SAP Cloud ALM to different organizational units in large enterprises or to separate SAP Cloud ALM for implementation and SAP Cloud ALM for operations.

-   Add a development or test tenant to the existing productive tenant, for example, to build and test extensions.

-   Separate systems from different landscapes, for example, for systems containing sensitive information.

-   Create training or playground environments.


From a functional and technical point of view, the additional tenants are identical to your original SAP Cloud ALM tenant. Each tenant comes with an additional 8 GB of SAP HANA memory and 8 GB of monthly outbound API data transfer, as well as the possibility to provision a Tricentis test automation tenant integrated with your additional tenant.

There's no restriction on the number of tenants which you can subscribe to. You can get as many as you need for your organization and purposes.

To get the additional tenant, first purchase the *SAP Cloud ALM, tenant extension*. Then, you can request the provisioning of your additional tenant or tenants on SAP for Me, as described in [Requesting SAP Cloud ALM](requesting-sap-cloud-alm-2ba35e6.md).
