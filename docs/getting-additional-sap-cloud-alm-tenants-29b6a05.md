# Getting Additional SAP Cloud ALM Tenants

By subscribing to *SAP Cloud ALM, tenant extension*, you can get additional SAP Cloud ALM tenants for your customer number.

Here's what you get by purchasing a tenant extension:

-   An entitlement for one additional SAP Cloud ALM tenant

-   An additional 8 GB of SAP HANA memory

-   An additional 8 GB of monthly outbound API data transfer

-   An entitlement for an additional Tricentis test automation for SAP tenant that is integrated with your additional tenant


> ### Note:  
> You don't have to request the provisioning of your additional SAP Cloud ALM tenant. Instead, you can also use the additional memory and data transfer volume on your existing SAP Cloud ALM tenant.
> 
> Each additional SAP Cloud ALM tenant will be provisioned in its own dedicated SAP BTP global account.

There's no restriction on the number of tenant extensions which you can subscribe to. You can get as many as you need for your organization and purposes.

From a functional and technical point of view, the additional tenants are identical to your original SAP Cloud ALM tenant. Here's how you can benefit from requesting additional tenants:

-   Use multiple productive tenants, for example, to provide SAP Cloud ALM to different organizational units in large enterprises or to separate SAP Cloud ALM for implementation and SAP Cloud ALM for operations.

-   Add a development or test tenant to the existing productive tenant, for example, to build and test extensions.

-   Separate systems from different landscapes, for example, for systems containing sensitive information.

-   Create training or playground environments.
