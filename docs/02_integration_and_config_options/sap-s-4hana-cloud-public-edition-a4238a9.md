# SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition

Enable the transport management with Adaptation Transport Organizer.

By enabling the transport management for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition with the Adaptation Transport Organizer \(ATO\), you can keep track of the deployment of transport requests through your implementation landscape.

> ### Note:  
> Only released transports can be assigned to features. For more information, see [Integration of Deployment Tools](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/deployment-tool-integration).

To use the ATO for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition in an SAP Cloud ALM environment, you have to establish a connection between SAP Cloud ALM and the ATO.

> ### Note:  
> Only transports exported after you established the connection of your SAP S/4HANA Cloud development and customizing system to SAP Cloud ALM are pushed to SAP Cloud ALM. Currently, there is no historic data available.

## Procedure

1.  Retrieve your *SAP Cloud ALM API* credentials as described in [Enabling SAP Cloud ALM API](enabling-sap-cloud-alm-api-704b5dc.md).

    Depending on the provisioning date of your SAP Cloud ALM tenant, the creation and configuration of your entitlements in the subaccount containing your SAP Cloud ALM subscription is generated automatically or has to be adjusted manually. See [Retrieving Service Credentials](retrieving-service-credentials-448f9f1.md).

    You can skip the steps altogether and access your credentials in the SAP BTP cockpit or in the *Landscape Management* app, as described in [Managing Your Service Credentials](managing-your-service-credentials-87b7851.md).

    Service credentials that can be used to connect managed services to SAP Cloud ALM for operations monitoring applications was generated automatically.

    You can access them in the SAP BTP cockpit or in the *Landscape Management* app, as described in [Managing Your Service Credentials](managing-your-service-credentials-87b7851.md).

    You only need to carry out the steps described in [Enabling SAP Cloud ALM API](enabling-sap-cloud-alm-api-704b5dc.md) if you want to set up transport management, but you no longer have to configure your entitlements.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you've already set up an instance previously, it's recommended to set up a new instance with a new name including the respective scopes. If the new instance works and the old one isn't needed anymore, you can delete the old instance.
    > 
    > The procedure for deleting an instance is described here: [Deleting Service Instances](https://help.sap.com/docs/service-manager/sap-service-manager/deleting-service-instances).

    > ### Note:  
    > If you want to enable the **SAP Cloud ALM API** in a Cloud Foundry environment, please refer to the following guide [Enabling SAP Cloud ALM API in Cloud Foundry](enabling-sap-cloud-alm-api-in-cloud-foundry-7d4c180.md). Note that this not the recommended approach anymore.

    > ### Note:  
    > For background information about communication systems in SAP S/4HANA Cloud context, please have a look at [Communication Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/2e84a10c430645a88bdbfaaa23ac9ff7.html?locale=en-US) 

2.  **Create communication system**: Create a communication system using the *Communication System* app that represents the SAP Cloud ALM tenant you want to communicate with.

    > ### Note:  
    > The following steps have to be performed for every tenant you want to establish.

    1.  In the *Communication Systems* app, set up a new communication system by choosing *New*.

        Set up a communication system using any ID in the *System ID* field and with a reasonable name \(for example the tenant name, you want to communicate with\) in the *System Name* field.

        ![](images/Create_New_System_2877b5c.png)

    2.  Choose *Create*.

    3.  In the next view, add the root URL from the SAP Cloud ALM API \(see step 1 of this guide\) in the*Host Name* field and the port \(443\) into the *Port* field in the *Technical Data - General* section.

        The relevant entry for the host name is the following: `{ “endpoints”: { “Api” . https://eu10.alm.cloud.sap/api }`. Enter the URL without the `/api` extension at the end.

        ![](images/Comm_arr_2_3e47062.png)

    4.  Add a token URL based on the UAA url from your SAP Cloud ALM API instance in the *Token Endpoint* field and add `/oauth/token` at the end of the URL.

        The token URL in the service key JSON file looks like that:`"url": "https://tenant-name.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com"`

        ![](images/Create_Outbound_User_474d537.png)

    5.  To create a new outbound user, go to the *Users for Outbound Communication* section of the *Communication Systems* app and choose :heavy_plus_sign:.

        ![](images/Create_Outbound_User_414da4f.png)

    6.  Choose Oauth 2.0 in the *Authentication Method* dropdown and enter your credentials based on client ID and secret from your SAP Cloud ALM API instance in the *OAuth 2.0 Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields.

        You can find the client ID and secret in the UAA section of the service key JSON and has a structure like in the following examples:`"clientid": "instance-name!b123456|sapcloudalm!b456789"` and `"clientsecret": "asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf"`.

        ![](images/Create_New_outbound_user_d68990b.png)

    7.  Choose *Create*.

        The entry now looks like this:

        ![](images/Users_for_Outbound_communcation_cc4e6ca.png)

    8.  Choose *Save*.


3.  **Create a communication arrangement**:

    1.  Create a communication arrangement in the *Communication Arrangement* app based on scenario SAP\_COM\_0690 and use the system that was created in step 2 of this guide.

        ![](images/SAP_Calm_ATO_0690_740e224.png)

    2.  Go to the *Outbound Services* section in the *Communication Arrangement* app. In this section you can find the following four outbound services.

        -   SAP Cloud ALM for implementation - Deployment Management Export

        -   SAP Cloud ALM for implementation - Deployment Management Import

        -   SAP Cloud ALM for implementation - Deployment Management Retry

        -   SAP Cloud ALM for implementation - Deployment Management Status Change


        In each of this outbound services, the same entries have to be filled out by you.

        ![](images/Outbound_Service_48c12fa.png)

        Make sure that the *Service Status* is marked as *Active* and that the *Port* entry is filled out with 443.

        In the *Job Execution Details* section, the *Job Status* doesn't have to be checked as this will be scheduled automatically in the background. Enter 5 minutes in the *Run Every* field.

        The *Package Size* entry can be ignored.

    3.  Choose *Save*.
