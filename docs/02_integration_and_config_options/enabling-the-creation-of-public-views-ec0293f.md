# Enabling the Creation of Public Views

In many SAP Cloud ALM apps, users can save common filter and table settings as personal views. To allow them to also create public views, which can be used by all users within your SAP Cloud ALM tenant, you need to create a custom role collection and assign it to them.

> ### Note:  
> Currently, public views can only be created in SAP Cloud ALM for implementation and SAP Business Transformation Center apps.

## Prerequisites

Your user has the role *Subaccount Administrator* in the subaccount that contains your SAP Cloud ALM subscription.

## Procedure

1.  Open the [SAP BTP cockpit](https://cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/).

3.  Choose *Security* \> *Role Collections*.

4.  Choose *Create*.

5.  Enter a unique name and description for the role collection, for example:

    -   *Name*: `Public View Editor`

    -   *Description*: `Create and edit public views, which are shared with all users in your SAP Cloud ALM tenant.`


6.  Open the created role collection and choose *Edit*.

7.  Under *Roles*, select the role `FlexPublicViewEditor` and choose *Add*.
