# Integrating Test Automation Providers

In addition to manual testing, which is performed directly in SAP Cloud ALM, you can also integrate SAP and third-party test automation providers with SAP Cloud ALM.

By integrating automation providers with SAP Cloud ALM, you can reduce your manual testing efforts and take advantage of its test orchestration, execution monitoring, and reporting capabilities.

SAP Cloud ALM currently supports the integration with the following automation providers:

-   [Test automation tool for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](integrating-the-test-automation-tool-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-0712254.md): Test all solution processes from the solution scenario SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.
