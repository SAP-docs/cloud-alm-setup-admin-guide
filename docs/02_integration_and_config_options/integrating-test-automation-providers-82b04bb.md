# Integrating Test Automation Providers

In addition to manual testing, which is performed directly in SAP Cloud ALM, you can also integrate SAP and third-party test automation providers that have implemented our public **Test Automation API**.

By integrating automation providers with SAP Cloud ALM, you can reduce your manual testing efforts and take advantage of its test orchestration, execution monitoring, and reporting capabilities.

SAP Cloud ALM currently supports the integration with the following automation providers:

-   [Test automation tool for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition](integrating-the-test-automation-tool-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-0712254.md): Conduct testing of all solution processes from the solution scenario SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.

-   [Tricentis Test Automation for SAP integrated with SAP Cloud ALM](setting-up-tricentis-test-automation-for-sap-integrated-with-sap-cloud-alm-2bddb58.md): Conduct testing of all browser-based SAP solutions and applications.


> ### Note:  
> The third-party vendor is responsible for ensuring the correct implementation of the Test Automation API and should be contacted in case of errors or for support.
