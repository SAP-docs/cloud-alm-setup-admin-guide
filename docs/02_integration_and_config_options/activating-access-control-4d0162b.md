# Activating Access Control

With access control, you can give users authorization for accessing specific landscape objects \(services, systems, and business services\).

By default, users with the appropriate roles can access landscape management and all landscape objects. There are no restrictions which landscape objects the user could see.

As a *Landscape Access Controller*, you can activate access control, which allows you to restrict the visibility of specific landscape objects to specific users. Which users can access which landscape objects is determined by *Access Control Lists*.

Currently, access control is used in *Landscape Management* and *Health Monitoring*.

> ### Note:  
> Once activated, you cannot deactivate access control any more due to security reasons. Therefore, before activating access control, first carry out the following steps:
> 
> -   Create a concept which users require access to which managed components.
> 
> -   Create corresponding *Access Control Lists*.
> 
> -   Assign users to their corresponding *Access Control Lists*.
> 
> -   Test access control.

Detailed information on how to activate access control can be found under [Access Control](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/access-control) and also in the [SAP Cloud ALM Expert Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/landscape-management/lms-access-control.html).
