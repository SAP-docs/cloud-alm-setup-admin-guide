# Retrieving Service Credentials

The connection between individual SAP Cloud applications and your managed systems and/or services is handled via an SAP Cloud ALM API service instance in your SAP Cloud ALM subaccount.

To set up the connection, you need to retrieve the service credentials \(that is, service binding or service key\) from the SAP Cloud ALM API instance.

Depending on the provisioning date of your SAP Cloud ALM tenant, some or all steps described in this document have already been automatically completed for you:
