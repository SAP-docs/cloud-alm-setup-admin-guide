> ### Note:  
> If you've purchased the *SAP Cloud ALM, tenant extension* and used the additional memory and data transfer volume on your existing SAP Cloud ALM tenant, this is not reflected here.
> 
> In that case, to get an overview of your current consumption, visit the [Finance & Legal](https://me.sap.com/financelegal) dashboard on SAP for Me. In the *Consumption* tab, you can find both the subscribed value and your current consumption.
