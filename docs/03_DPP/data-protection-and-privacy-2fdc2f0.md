# Data Protection and Privacy

Data protection is associated with numerous legal requirements and privacy concerns.

In addition to compliance with general data protection and privacy acts, it’s necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries. SAP provides specific features and functions to support compliance with regard to relevant legal requirements, including data protection. SAP doesn’t give any advice on whether these features and functions are the best method to support company, industry, regional, or country-specific requirements.

Furthermore, this information shouldn’t be taken as advice or a recommendation regarding additional features that would be required in specific IT environments. Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.

> ### Note:  
> SAP doesn’t provide legal advice in any form. SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and specific data protection-relevant functions, such as simplified blocking and deletion of personal data. In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws won’t be covered by a product feature. Definitions and other terms used in this document aren’t taken from a particular legal source.

SAP Cloud ALM is compliant with DSGVO and GDPR.
